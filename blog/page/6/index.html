  <div class="entry-content"><p>My brother and I were hanging out and doing some studying when he showed me a description about this psychology experiment that was done. Apparently this psychologist showed Americans a mix of food and tools and asked them to separate them into categories. Of course they separated them into a pile of food and a pile of tools.The same thing was done with a group of Africans, and they separated them into a few different categories: potatoes with the hoe, oranges with a knife, etc. When they were asked why they grouped them in that way, they responded, &#8220;Because that&#8217;s how a wise man would categorize them.&#8221; When asked what a fool would do, they proceeded to separate the mix into a pile of food and a pile of tools.What has consumerism done to America?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Through some administrative loophole, one of my high school teachers discovered that he could show anything he wanted (within his moral conscience) during lunch time without getting our parents&#8217; permission. Out of all things, he decided to show us South Park. The only reason I&#8217;m bringing this up is that I came across <a href="http://allabout-sp.net/?p=episodes">this website that has archived all the episodes of South Park online</a> and it brought back some fond memories of my teacher. =)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>From St. Augustine&#8217;s <em>The Literal Meaning of Genesis</em>:</p>


<p>&#8220;Usually, even a non-Christian knows something about the earth, the heavens, and the other elements of this world, about the motion and orbit of the stars and even their size and relative positions, about the predictable eclipses of the sun and moon, the cycles of the years and the seasons, about the kinds of animals, shrubs, stones, and so forth, and this knowledge he hold to as being certain from reason and experience.<strong> Now, it is a disgraceful and dangerous thing for an infidel to hear a Christian, presumably giving the meaning of Holy Scripture, talking nonsense on these topics; and we should take all means to prevent such an embarrassing situation, in which people show up vast ignorance in a Christian and laugh it to scorn. The shame is not so much that an ignorant individual is derided, but that people outside the household of faith think our sacred writers held such opinions, and, to the great loss of those for whose salvation we toil, the writers of our Scripture are criticized and rejected as unlearned men. </strong> If they find a Christian mistaken in a field which they themselves know well and hear him maintaining his foolish opinions about our books, how are they going to believe those books in matters concerning the resurrection of the dead, the hope of eternal life, and the kingdom of heaven, when they think their pages are full of falsehoods and on facts which they themselves have learnt from experience and the light of reason? Reckless and incompetent expounders of Holy Scripture bring untold trouble and sorrow on their wiser brethren when they are caught in one of their mischievous false opinions and are taken to task by those who are not bound by the authority of our sacred books. For then, to defend their utterly foolish and obviously untrue statements, they will try to call upon Holy Scripture for proof and even recite from memory many passages which they think support their position, although they understand neither what they say nor the things about which they make assertion. [1 Timothy 1.7]&#8221;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>With the rush to get home last Friday, I realized that there were a few stories from last week that I forgot to include. Here&#8217;s one from last Friday:</p>


<p>Orthopedic surgeons have a reputation of being a &#8220;boys club&#8221; and surprisingly I made it through 3 weeks of ortho before coming face to face with my first trial. My attending, my fellow, and I were scrubbed in (with space suits) on a case of total knee replacement and we got to the part where we rub the cement into the ball head and smack it into place with a hammer. After my fellow scrapped off the extra white goo, he handed a big ball of it to me and said, &#8220;I want you to make a fist and hold on to that. I don&#8217;t want to see you lose your grip.&#8221;</p>


<p>Being the clueless medical student that I am, I played along, and after a few minutes of both the attending and the fellow snickering at me, I realized that something bad was going to happen. Sure enough my hand started to get a little warm, so I asked, &#8220;Umm&#8230; Is it suppose to get warm?&#8221; My fellow turns to me, smiles innocently, and says, &#8220;In a few minutes, your hand is going to get scorching hot.&#8221;</p>


<p>A few more minutes go by, and soon my hand feels like its gripping a boiling pot of water. Since I&#8217;m on the rotation, I decided to play along and out-smart them. While they weren&#8217;t looking, I slightly let go of the cement so that there was a few millimeters of air between my hand and the cement. Believe me, it made all the difference in the world.</p>


<p>Finally, my fellow and attending turns back to me and says, &#8220;Is it hot now?&#8221; I tell them, &#8220;Eh&#8230; kinda,&#8221; and I hand them the rock hard cement that&#8217;s already cooled down. My fellow looks at me and says, &#8220;Wow&#8230; I didn&#8217;t expect you to actually hold on to it the whole time. I&#8217;ve never seen anyone do that before. Did you burn your hand?&#8221;</p>


<p>Oh the trials of a third year medical student&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Amazingly exactly a week later, Denver was hit by <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/weather/storms/2006-12-29-snowstorm_x.htm?POE=NEWISVA">another snowstorm</a>. Some parts of Denver even got 27 inches of snow!
