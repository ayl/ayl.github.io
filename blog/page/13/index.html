		<p>After some digging, here is the official text from North Korea about the nuclear testing:</p>


<p>&#8220;The field of scientific research in the DPRK successfully conducted an underground nuclear test under secure conditions on October 9, 2006, at a stirring time when all the people of the country are making a great leap forward in the building of a great, prosperous, powerful socialist nation.</p>


<p>&#8220;It has been confirmed that there was no such danger as radioactive emission in the course of the nuclear test as it was carried out under scientific consideration and careful calculation.</p>


<p>&#8220;The nuclear test was conducted with indigenous wisdom and technology 100 percent. It marks a historic event as it greatly encouraged and pleased the KPA and people that have wished to have powerful self-reliant defense capability.</p>


<p>&#8220;It will contribute to defending the peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and in the area around it.&#8221;</p>

			On North Korea&#8230;</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>One wonders if the <a href="http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=topNews&storyID=2006-10-09T112354Z_01_L08141538_RTRUKOC_0_US-KOREA-NORTH.xml&WTmodLoc=NewsHome-C1-topNews-3">recent events</a> in North Korea is Kim Jung Il&#8217;s attempt to protest <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/09/world/asia/10bancnd.html?hp&ex=1160452800&en=c3afde6ebcf1c651&ei=5094&partner=homepage">the recent election of the new UN Secretary General</a>. Here is the excerpt from Bush&#8217;s press release this morning:</p>


<h3 class="contenttitle">Bush Statement on North Korea&#8217;s Nuclear Claim</h3>


<p><!-- start inset column -->                      <!-- end inset column / start center column --><em>Below is the text of President Bush&#8217;s statement, as released by the White House, on North Korea&#8217;s claim that it had conducted a nuclear test.</em></p>


<p>Last night the government of North Korea proclaimed to the world that it had conducted a nuclear test. We&#8217;re working to confirm North Korea&#8217;s claim. Nonetheless, such a claim itself constitutes a threat to international peace and security. The United States condemns this provocative act. Once again North Korea has defied the will of the international community, and the international community will respond.</p>


<p>This was confirmed this morning in conversations I had with leaders of China, and South Korea, Russia, and Japan. We reaffirmed our commitment to a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula, and all of us agreed that the proclaimed actions taken by North Korea are unacceptable and deserve an immediate response by the United Nations Security Council.</p>


<p>The North Korean regime remains one of the world&#8217;s leading proliferator of missile technology, including transfers to Iran and Syria. The transfer of nuclear weapons or material by North Korea to states or non-state entities would be considered a grave threat to the United States, and we would hold North Korea fully accountable of the consequences of such action.</p>


<p>The United States remains committed to diplomacy, and we will continue to protect ourselves and our interests. I reaffirmed to our allies in the region, including South Korea and Japan, that the United States will meet the full range of our deterrent and security commitments.</p>


<p>Threats will not lead to a brighter future for the North Korean people, nor weaken the resolve of the United States and our allies to achieve the de-nuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Today&#8217;s claim by North Korea serves only to raise tensions, while depriving the North Korean people of the increased prosperity and better relations with the world offered by the implementation of the joint statement of the six-party talks. The oppressed and impoverished people of North Korea deserve that brighter future.</p>


<p>Thank you.</p>

		<p>I learned two important things yesterday on my way back from Washington DC. First, never sit in the row before the emergency exit row on the plane because you won&#8217;t be able to lean back and there&#8217;s nothing you can do if the row before you decides to invade your personal space. Second, there is no such thing as the 13th row. I never noticed until yesterday. Appartently, it has gone the same way as the 13th floor. But wouldn&#8217;t the entire plane be unlucky if something happened to the people sitting in the 13th row?</p>

		<p>Today, I was sitting in a patient room staring up at the sky, and I wanted to curl up into a ball and go to sleep for a long, long time.

Did you know that you never really get rid of sleep debt and that it just continually builds up until you can sleep it off?</p>

			Impressions About Psych&#8230;</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Now that I&#8217;m more than halfway through psych and have suffered through a few call nights. I feel that now would be a good time to re-evaluate what I think about psych. Usually what happens with each rotation that I&#8217;ve been is that I&#8217;ll be absolutely miserable for the first few weeks and then grow to like the rotation more and more as the time goes on.</p>


<p>Psych itself has been an interesting experience in that the first few weeks I didn&#8217;t feel like I was helping anybody at all, but the patients were fascinating in how different they were. Now that I&#8217;ve got a little more firm grasp of the psych wards I&#8217;ve become to appreciate it more. I realized that I like the subtle ways of phrasing sentances so that patients will help you help them, and the uniquness of the field of psychiatry in that this is probably the only field of medicine where you can&#8217;t trust the patients nor do some of the patients want to be helped. Ironically, psych seems to be closest to pediatrics in similarity: you can&#8217;t trust what the kids tell you, and not all the kids want to get better (especially if it involves a shot).</p>
