  <div class="entry-content"><p>So it turns out that I will <strong>not</strong> be in Boston this evening nor even this weekend. The airline called before I got on the Metrolink to the airport informing me that my flight had been canceled and that the earliest that they could get me to Boston would be tomorrow afternoon at 3pm, leaving me with a grand total of 30 hours in Boston before I would have to come back. I got my ticket refunded instead&#8230; I guess I wasn&#8217;t meant to go this weekend.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So last night Ambrose and I had the crazy idea of watching 007 on opening night, so we bought tickets online and got excited. Because we are third years, we thought it would be prudent to at least take a little nap for a few hours before going go see the midnight showing. The plan was for Ambrose to come and wake me up at 11:00 pm&#8230; The next thing I know it&#8217;s midnight, and I wake up naturally with the feeling that something was very, very wrong. I rushed into Ambrose&#8217;s room to find him sound asleep. -.-</p>


<p>Now it&#8217;s 5:30 am and I still have to pack for my trip&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m perpetually tired these days even though I try to get 8 hours of sleep in. I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on, but I keep waking up at night. I&#8217;ve been trying to take Ambien but that makes me really sleepy in the morning&#8230; I don&#8217;t know what to do&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Chest radiology has an obsession, I&#8217;ve decided, of looking for nipples. Last week there was an episode of one case where the attending, the resident, and me were trying to decide if what we were seeing was a nipple or lung cancer for approximately 30 minutes. Then today I was pimped on a chest x-ray by an attending on a nipple again.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So there is a church in St. Louis called <a href="http://www.newcity.org/index.asp">New City Fellowship</a>. Today they had a &#8220;work day&#8221; where they invite churches all over St. Louis to come and help out with different projects. I was prepared to do any kind of work, but honestly I didn&#8217;t expect that it would include jumping up and down in a dumpster for the better part of the time there. It was good, fun hard work though. =)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I don&#8217;t think I can take any more stressors&#8230; My laptop has been making this strange hard disk sound that I can&#8217;t figure out what&#8217;s causing it. For the past few weeks even when no program is touching the disk, periodically it will make this short burst of sound as something accesses the hard disk. I&#8217;ve tried everything: turning off all the services on my computer, shutting off the indexing and system restore, turning off the internet, turning off the virtual memory, and even reinstalling windows and trying all of the above again. Nothing seems to work.</p>


<p>I liken every moment that my laptop is turned on to the Chinese water torture. You know that the blissful sound of silence is going to be interrupted by that infernal sound but you don&#8217;t know when exactly. All you can do is pull your hair out while you wait for it to come. I really think my sanity is going to break.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So the first week of radiology is almost over, and the lack of any kind of light is starting to get to me. I wake up at dawn and before you can see the sun above the horizon, I&#8217;ve entered the reading rooms where the only source of light is the glow of the LCD screens. By the time I finish, I get out and I find myself in more darkness. It&#8217;s kind of maddening&#8230; You never know how much you miss something until it&#8217;s stolen away from you, as the popular adage goes, but seriously who thought you could miss sunlight so much?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I believe people should practice civil disobedience by not voting. Politics these days are not about issues that are important but more about issues that can be turned into political platforms through which people may be swayed. It is not healthy as a society to waste money, time, and energy on issues that have no practical bearing with no personal conviction of the representatives of either party. It is entirely questionable what one side truly believes and the other side blasphemies using religion for personal gain. In essence, politics of late has become a festering ground of wasted debates and arguments, much to the woe of the country.</p>
